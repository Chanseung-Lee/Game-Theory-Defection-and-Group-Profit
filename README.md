# Introduction
The prisoner’s dilemma is a game theory framework illustrating two rational individuals making decisions in their own self-interest. Two players simultaneously take a choice between two options: to cooperate, or to defect. If two players repeat the same prisoner’s dilemma game in succession, however, and if it's given that both players remember the previous actions of all players, the game is called an iterated prisoner’s dilemma. In this version, the game is played repeatedly between the same players, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If information regarding the number of times the game is played is available to the players, then by backward induction the two rational players will betray each other repeatedly due to the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy.

In this paper, we look at the iterated prisoner’s dilemma issue from a unique angle. We concentrate on the performance of the group as a whole, rather than on the performance of an individual. The goal is to maximize the group’s overall benefit, regardless of how each player performs.
Some members of a group cooperate, while others defect. Of course, some of the group members, as they cooperate and defect based on their individual strategies, will fare better than others. Given the present level of defection in a group, our focus is to analyze the effects of individual defection in terms of group benefit.

We look into whether pure angels that only choose to cooperate perform the best as a group, or if additional greed is required to maximize performance. How much defection, if necessary, is required to optimize a group’s advantages? In this study, we explore these problems, and seek to identify the effect of defection to maximize group benefit.
